With Instana, you can export directly to an Instana Agent in your cluster. The Instana Agent will report back the tracing and metrics to the Instana Backend and display them on the Instana UI.

After an Instana OS agent is installed, edit the agent config file `configuration.yaml` under the `/opt/instana/agent/etc/instana folder`.

```bash
cd /opt/instana/agent/etc/instana
vi configuration.yaml
```

Add the following to the file:

```yaml
com.instana.plugin.opentelemetry:
  enabled: true
  grpc:
    enabled: true
```

Restart the Instana agent:

```
systemctl restart instana-agent.service
```

The Instana agent should be ready for OpenTelemetry data at `port 4317`.

Finally, set this env var, and youâ€™re done!

```
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=<instana-agent-hostname>:4317
```
