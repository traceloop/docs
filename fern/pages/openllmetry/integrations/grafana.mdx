## Access Grafana Cloud Account for Tempo Integration

Go to the Grafana Cloud account page under `https://grafana.com/orgs/<your org name>`, and click on **Send Traces** under Tempo

### Retrieve URL from Grafana Data Source Settings

In **Grafana Data Source settings**, note the **URL** value

### Generate API Key for Tempo Integration

Click **Generate now** to generate an API key and copy it

### Record Stack ID for Integration Configuration

Note also the **Stack ID** value.

You can find it in the URL `https://grafana.com/orgs/<Your Org Name>/stacks/<Stack ID>`.

## With Grafana Agent
Make sure you have an agent installed and running in your cluster. The host to target your traces is constructed is the hostname of the `URL` noted above, without the `https://` and the trailing `/tempo`.

### Update Agent Configuration

Add this to the configuration of your agent:

```yaml
traces:
  configs:
    - name: default
      remote_write:
        - endpoint: <Grafana Hostname>:443
          basic_auth:
            username: <Stack ID from Grafana Cloud>
            password: <Grafana Cloud API Token>
      receivers:
        otlp:
          protocols:
            grpc:
```

<Callout intent="warn">
Note the endpoint. The URL you need to use is without `https` and the trailing `/`. So `https://tempo-us-central1.grafana.net/tempo` should be used as `tempo-us-central1.grafana.net:443`.
</Callout>

### Set Environmental Variable

Set this as an environment variable in your app:

```
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=http://<grafana-agent-hostname>:4318
```

## Without Grana Agent

<Callout intent="info">
Grafana cloud currently only supports sending traces to some of its regions. Before you begin, [check out this list](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/monitor-infrastructure/otlp/send-data-otlp/) and make sure your region is supported.
</Callout>

### Get your encoded User ID and API Key

In a terminal, type:

```
echo -n "<your stack id>:<your api key>" | base64
```

The result which is a base64 encoding of your user id and api key.

### Get your URL

The URL you’ll use as the destination for the traces depends on your region/zone. For example, for AWS US Central this will be `prod-us-central-0`. See [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/monitor-infrastructure/otlp/send-data-otlp/#before-you-begin) for the names of the zones you should use below.

### Set your environmental variables

Finally, you can set the following environment variables when running your app with Traceloop SDK installed:

```
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=https://otlp-gateway-<zone>.grafana.net/otlp
TRACELOOP_HEADERS="Authorization=Basic%20<base64 encoded stack id and api key>"
```
