- Analyze all collected LLM traces within Dynatrace by using the native OpenTelemetry ingest endpoint of your Dynatrace environment.

- Go to your Dynatrace environment and create a new access token under **Manage Access Tokens**.

- The access token needs the following permission scopes that allow the ingest of OpenTelemetry spans, metrics and logs (`openTelemetryTrace.ingest`, `metrics.ingest`, `logs.ingest`).

- Set `TRACELOOP_BASE_URL` environment variable to the URL of your Dynatrace OpenTelemetry ingest endpoint.

```
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=https://<YOUR_ENV>.live.dynatrace.com\api\v2\otlp
```

- Set the `TRACELOOP_HEADERS` environment variable to include your previously created access token

```
TRACELOOP_HEADERS=Authorization=Api-Token%20<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>
```

- You're all set! All the exported spans along with their span attributes will show up within the Dynatrace trace view.
