title: LLM observability with OpenTelemetry Collector
---

Since Traceloop is emitting standard OTLP HTTP (standard OpenTelemetry protocol), you can use any OpenTelemetry Collector, which gives you the flexibility to then connect to any backend you want. First, [deploy an OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/kubernetes/operator/automatic/#create-an-opentelemetry-collector-optional) in your cluster. Then, point the output of the Traceloop SDK to the collector by setting:

```
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=https://<opentelemetry-collector-hostname>:4318
```

You can connect your collector to Traceloop by following the instructions in the [Traceloop integration section](/docs/openllmetry/integrations/traceloop#using-an-opentelemetry-collector).
