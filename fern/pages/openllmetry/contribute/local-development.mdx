You can contribute both new instrumentations or update and improve the different SDKs.

The Python and Typescript are monorepos that use nx to manage the different packages. Make sure you have node >= 18 and nx installed globally.

## Basic guide for using nx

Most commands can be run from the root of the project. For example, to lint the entire project, run:

```bash
nx run-many -t lint
```

Other commands you can use simiarily are `test`, or `build`, or `lock` and `install` (for Python).

To run a specific command on a specific package, run:

```bash
nx run <package>:<command>
```

## Python

We use `poetry` to manage packages, and each package is managed independently under its own directory under `/packages`. All instrumentations depends on `opentelemetry-semantic-conventions-ai`, and `traceloop-sdk` depends on all the instrumentations.

If adding a new instrumentation, make sure to use it in `traceloop-sdk`, and write proper tests.

### Debugging

No matter if youâ€™re working on an instrumentation or on the SDK, we recommend testing the changes by using the SDK in the sample app (`/packages/sample-app`) or the tests under the SDK.

### Running tests

We record HTTP requests and then replay them in tests to avoid making actual calls to the foundation model providers. See [vcr.py](https://github.com/kevin1024/vcrpy) and [pollyjs](https://github.com/Netflix/pollyjs/) to do that, check out their documentation to understand how to use them and re-record the requests.

You can run all tests by running:

```bash
nx run-many -t test
```

Or run a specific test by running:

```bash
nx run <package>:test
```

For example, to run the tests for the openai instrumentation package, run:

<CodeBlocks>
    <CodeBlock title="Python">
    ```bash
    nx run opentelemetry-instrumentation-openai:test
    ```
    </CodeBlock>
    <CodeBlock title="Typescript">
    ```bash
    nx run @traceloop/instrumentation-openai:test
    ```
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeBlocks>

## Typescript

We use `npm` with workspaces to manage packages in the monorepo. Install by running `npm install` in the root of the project. Each package has its own test suite. You can use the sample app to run and test changes locally.
