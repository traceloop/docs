OpenLLMetry contains a telemetry feature that collects anonymous usage information.

<Callout intent="success">
Not to be confused with OpenTelemetry. Telemetry refers to anonymous product usage statistics we collect. It is a completely different stream of data, and is not related to OpenTelemetry, traces, or instrumentations.
</Callout>

## Why?

We use this information to help us understand how OpenLLMetry is used, to help us prioritize work on new features and bug fixes, and to help us improve OpenLLMetryâ€™s performance and stability.

## Opting out

If you prefer to opt out of telemetry, you can do this by setting the `TRACELOOP_TELEMETRY` environment variable to `FALSE`.

## What do you track?

We will only track usage details that help us make product decisions, specifically:

- OpenLLMetry version
- Tracing endpoint type (e.g. Honeycomb, Datadog, Traceloop, etc.)
- Types of instrumentations that were initialized
- Usage of prompt rendering (without logging any details about the prompt, variables, or values)

We **do not** collect personally-identifiable or sensitive information, such as: API keys, prompts, completions, embeddings, or spans and traces.

To view the list of events we track, you may reference the [code](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry/blob/main/packages/traceloop-sdk/traceloop/sdk/telemetry.py).

## Where is telemetry information stored?

We use Posthog to store and visualize telemetry data.
