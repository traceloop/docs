excerpt: How to associate traces with entities in your own application
---

Each trace you run is usually connected to entities in your own application - things like `user_id`, `chat_id`, or anything else that is tied to the flow that triggered the trace.

OpenLLMetry allows you to easily mark traces with these IDs so you can track them in the UI.

<Callout intent="tip">
You can use any key-value pair to associate a trace with an entity - it can also be `org_id`, `team_id`, whatever you want. The only requirement is that the key and the value are strings.

    ```typescript
    // Option 1 - set association properties within a workflow, task, agent or tool
    traceloop.withWorkflow(

        associationProperties:
            { userId: "user12345", chatId: "chat12345" }

        () => {
        // Your code here
        // (function can be made async if needed)
    });

    // Option 2  - set association properties directly
    traceloop.withAssociationProperties({
    userId: "user12345",
    chatId: "chat12345",

        // Your code here
