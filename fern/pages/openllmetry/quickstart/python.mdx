You can also check out our full working example of a RAG pipeline with Pinecone [here](https://github.com/traceloop/pinecone-demo).

<Steps>

### Install the SDK

Run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeBlocks>
    <CodeBlock title="pip">
    ```bash
    pip install traceloop-sdk
    ```
    </CodeBlock>
    <CodeBlock title="poetry">
    ```bash
    poetry add traceloop-sdk
    ```
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeBlocks>

In your LLM app, initialize the Traceloop tracer like this:

```python
from traceloop.sdk import Traceloop

Traceloop.init()
```

If you’re running this locally, you may want to disable batch sending, so you can see the traces immediately:

```python
Traceloop.init(disable_batch=True)
```

### Annotate your workflows

</Frame>

If you have complex workflows or chains, you can annotate them to get a better understanding of what’s going on. You’ll see the complete trace of your workflow on Traceloop or any other dashboard you’re using.

We have a set of [decorators](/open-ll-metry/tracing/workflows-tasks-agents-and-tools) to make this easier. Assume you have a function that renders a prompt and calls an LLM, simply add `@workflow` (or for asynchronous methods - `@aworkflow`).

<Callout intent="info">
If you’re using an LLM framework like Haystack, Langchain or LlamaIndex - we’ll do that for you. No need to add any annotations to your code.
</Callout>

```python
from traceloop.sdk.decorators import workflow

@workflow(name="suggest_answers")
def suggest_answers(question: str):

...
```

For more information, see the [dedicated section in the docs](/open-ll-metry/tracing/workflows-tasks-agents-and-tools).

### Configure trace exporting

Lastly, you’ll need to configure where to export your traces. The 2 environment variables controlling this are `TRACELOOP_API_KEY` and `TRACELOOP_BASE_URL`.

For Traceloop, read on. For other options, see [Exporting](/open-ll-metry/integrations/overview).


### Using Traceloop Cloud

Go to [Traceloop](https://app.traceloop.com/), and create a new account. Then, click on **Environments** on the left-hand navigation bar. Or go to directly to https://app.traceloop.com/settings/api-keys. Click **Generate API Key** to generate an API key for the developement environment and click **Copy API Key** to copy it over.

<Callout intent="warn">
Make sure to copy it as it won’t be shown again.
</Callout>

<Frame>
![openllmetry-python-2](https://fern-image-hosting.s3.amazonaws.com/traceloop/openllmetry-python-2.png)
</Frame>

Set the copied Traceloop’s API key as an environment variable in your app named `TRACELOOP_API_KEY`.

</Steps>

You're all set! You’ll get instant visibility into everything that’s happening with your LLM. If you’re calling a vector DB, or any other external service or database, you’ll also see it in the Traceloop dashboard.
