<Steps>
### Install the SDK

Run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeBlocks>
    <CodeBlock title="gem">
    ```bash
    gem install traceloop-sdk
    ```
    </CodeBlock>
    <CodeBlock title="bundler">
    ```bash
    bundle add traceloop-sdk
    ```
    </CodeBlock>
</CodeBlocks>

In your LLM app, initialize the Traceloop tracer like this:

```Ruby
require "traceloop/sdk"

traceloop = Traceloop::SDK::Traceloop.new
```

<Callout intent="tip">
If you’re using Rails, this needs to be in `config/initializers/traceloop.rb`
</Callout>

### Log your prompts

For now, we don’t automatically instrument libraries on Ruby (as opposed to Python and Javascript). This will change in later versions.

This means that you’ll need to manually log your prompts and completions.

```ruby
require "openai"

client = OpenAI::Client.new

# This tracks the latency of the call and the response
traceloop.llm_call() do |tracer|
  # Log the prompt
  tracer.log_prompt(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", user_prompt="Tell me a joke about OpenTelemetry")

  # Call OpenAI like you normally would
  response = client.chat(
    parameters: {
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Tell me a joke about OpenTelemetry" }]
    })

  # Pass the response form OpenAI as is to log the completion and token usage
  tracer.log_response(response)
end
```

### Configure Trace Exporting

Lastly, you’ll need to configure where to export your traces. The 2 environment variables controlling this are `TRACELOOP_API_KEY` and `TRACELOOP_BASE_URL`.

For Traceloop, read on. For other options, see [Exporting](/docs/openllmetry/integrations/overview).

<h3>Using Traceloop Cloud</h3>

Go to [Traceloop](https://app.traceloop.com/), and create a new account. Then, click on **Environments** on the left-hand navigation bar. Or go to directly to https://app.traceloop.com/settings/api-keys. Click **Generate API Key** to generate an API key for the development environment and click **Copy API Key** to copy it over.

<Callout intent="warning">
Make sure to copy it as it won’t be shown again.

<Frame>
![openllmetry-ruby-2](https://fern-image-hosting.s3.amazonaws.com/traceloop/openllmetry-ruby-2.png)
</Frame>

Set the copied Traceloop’s API key as an environment variable in your app named `TRACELOOP_API_KEY`.

You're all set! You’ll get instant visibility into everything that’s happening with your LLM. If you’re calling a vector DB, or any other external service or database, you’ll also see it in the Traceloop dashboard.
