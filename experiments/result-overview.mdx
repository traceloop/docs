All experiments are logged in the Traceloop platform. Each experiment is executed through the SDK.

## Experiment Runs
An experiment can be run multiple times against different datasets and tasks. All runs are logged in the Traceloop platform to enable easy comparison.

## Experiment Tasks

An experiment run is made up of multiple tasks, where each task represents the experiment flow applied to a single dataset row.

The task logging captures:

- Task input – the data taken from the dataset row.

- Task outputs – the results produced by running the task, which are then passed as input to the evaluator.

- Evaluator results – the evaluator’s assessment based on the task outputs.
