## Connection Issues

### ClickHouse Connection Failures

Common issues and their solutions when connecting to ClickHouse:

- Verify the host and port are correct
- Ensure the database exists and the user has appropriate permissions
- For ClickHouse Cloud, set `isCloud: true` in your configuration
- Check if SSL is required (`secure: true`)
- Verify network connectivity and firewall rules

### Kafka Connection Issues

If you're having trouble connecting to Kafka:

- Confirm broker addresses are accessible from the Kubernetes cluster
- For Confluent Cloud:
  - Ensure SASL authentication is properly configured
  - Verify SSL is enabled
- Check topic creation permissions
- Verify network policies allow Kafka connectivity

### PostgreSQL Connection Problems

Common PostgreSQL connectivity issues:

- Verify database exists and is accessible
- Check user permissions (needs ability to create schemas and tables)
- For SSL connections, ensure proper SSL mode is set
- Verify PostgreSQL version compatibility (9.6 or higher)

## Kubernetes Deployment Issues

### Pod Startup Failures

If pods aren't starting properly:

```bash
# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n traceloop

# Check pod events
kubectl describe pod -n traceloop <pod-name>

# Check pod logs
kubectl logs -n traceloop <pod-name>
```

Common solutions:

- Verify resource requests and limits are appropriate
- Ensure all secrets are properly created
- Check container image pull permissions

### Ingress Issues

If you can't access Traceloop through your ingress:

- Verify ingress controller is installed
- Check TLS secret exists if TLS is enabled
- Ensure DNS records are properly configured
- Verify ingress annotations match your environment

```bash
# Check ingress status
kubectl get ingress -n traceloop

# Check ingress details
kubectl describe ingress -n traceloop
```

## Air-Gapped Environment Issues

### Image Pull Failures

For air-gapped environments:

- Ensure all required images are available in your private registry
- Configure `imageRegistry` settings correctly:
  ```yaml
  platform:
    imageRegistry:
      url: "your-private-registry.com"
      secretName: "registry-credentials"
  ```
- Verify registry credentials are properly set
- Check network connectivity to private registry

## Common Error Messages

### "Error: connection refused"

Check component connectivity:

```bash
# Test ClickHouse connectivity
kubectl exec -it -n traceloop deploy/traceloop-api -- nc -vz your-clickhouse-host 9000

# Test Kafka connectivity
kubectl exec -it -n traceloop deploy/traceloop-api -- nc -vz your-kafka-broker 9092

# Test PostgreSQL connectivity
kubectl exec -it -n traceloop deploy/traceloop-api -- nc -vz your-postgres-host 5432
```

### "Error: authentication failed"

Authentication issues:

- Verify credentials in your values.yaml
- Check if secrets are properly mounted
- Ensure service accounts have necessary permissions
- Verify SSL/TLS configuration if required

### "Error: insufficient permissions"

Permission-related problems:

- Check RBAC configuration
- Verify service account permissions
- Ensure necessary Kubernetes roles are created
- Check database user permissions

## Quick Validation Checklist

1. Component Connectivity

   - All infrastructure components are reachable
   - Proper ports are open
   - Network policies allow required traffic

2. Authentication & Permissions

   - Database credentials are correct
   - Kubernetes secrets exist and are mounted
   - Service accounts have required permissions

3. Infrastructure Health

   - Kubernetes nodes are healthy
   - Sufficient resources are available
   - Storage is properly configured

4. Logging & Monitoring
   - Check pod logs: `kubectl logs -n traceloop -l app=traceloop`
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Review infrastructure metrics

## Debug Mode

To enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

1. Update your values.yaml:

```yaml
platform:
  logging:
    level: debug
```

2. Upgrade your deployment:

```bash
helm upgrade traceloop traceloop/traceloop \
  --namespace traceloop \
  --values values.yaml
```

3. Check the debug logs:

```bash
kubectl logs -n traceloop -l app=traceloop --tail=100
```
