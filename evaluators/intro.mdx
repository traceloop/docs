The evaluation library is a core feature of Traceloop, providing comprehensive tools to assess LLM outputs, data quality, and performance across various dimensions. Whether you need automated scoring or human judgment, the evaluation system has you covered.

## Evaluators types

The system supports: 
- **Custom evaluators** - Create your own evaluation logic tailored to specific needs
- **Built-in evaluators** - pre-configured evaluators by Traceloop for common assessment tasks

In the Evaluator Library, select the evaluator you want to define. 
You can either create a custom evaluator by clicking **New Evaluator** or choose one of the prebuilt **Made by Traceloop** evaluators.

Clicking on existing evaluators will present their input and output schema. This is valuable information in order to execute the evaluator [through the SDK](../experiments/running-from-code).
