Create your own evaluator to match your specific needs. You can start right away with custom criteria for full flexibility, or use one of our recommended formats as a starting point.

## Do It Yourself

This option lets you write the evaluator prompt from scratch by adding the desired messages (System, Assistant, User, or Developer) and configuring the model along with its settings.

## Generate Evaluator

The evaluator prompt can be automatically configured by Traceloop by clicking on the **Generate Evaluator** button. 
To enable the button, map the column you want to evaluate (such as an LLM response) and add any additional data columns required for prompt creation. 
Describe the evaluatorâ€™s purpose and reference the relevant data columns in the description.

The system generates a prompt template that you can edit and customize as needed.


## Test Evaluator 

Before creating an evaluator, you can test it on existing Playground data. 
This allows you to refine and correct the evaluator prompt before saving the final version.

## Execute Evaluator

Evaluators can be executed in [playground columns](../playgrounds/columns/column-management) and in [experiments through the SDK](../experiments/running-from-code).
