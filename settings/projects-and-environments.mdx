## Why Projects and Environments?

### The Problem

When you have multiple applications or deployment stages:
- Traces from different services get mixed together
- Production data appears alongside development experiments
- Team members see irrelevant data from other projects
- Testing changes risks affecting production monitoring

### The Solution

**Projects** completely isolate data for different applications:
- Each project has its own traces, datasets, prompts, evaluators, and experiments
- Switch between projects to view specific application data
- Generate separate API keys per project

**Environments** separate deployment stages within a project:
- dev, stg, and prd environments (built-in)
- Custom environments (e.g., "qa", "eu-prd", "preview")
- Each environment has its own API key and data stream

## Understanding Projects

### What is a Project?

A project is a complete isolation boundary for all your Traceloop data. Think of it as a workspace for a specific application or service.

**Each project contains:**
- Traces and spans
- Datasets for experiments
- Prompt configurations
- Evaluators and monitors
- Experiment results

**Common use cases for creating projects:**
- Separate applications (e.g., "web-app", "mobile-app", "api-service")
- Microservices in a distributed system
- Different teams or product areas
- Major feature branches or product lines

### When to Create a New Project

✅ **Create a new project when:**
- Building a new application or service
- Separating data for different teams
- Testing major architectural changes in isolation
- Managing multi-tenant applications (one project per tenant)

❌ **Don't create a new project for:**
- Different deployment stages (use environments instead)
- Temporary experiments (use Development environment)
- A/B tests (use datasets and experiments features)

## Understanding Environments

### What is an Environment?

An environment represents a deployment stage within a project. Each environment has its own API key, allowing you to send traces from different stages without mixing the data.

**Default environments** (cannot be deleted):
- **dev**: Local development and testing
- **stg**: Pre-production testing and validation
- **prd**: Live production traffic

**Custom environments**: Add your own based on your workflow
- Examples: "qa", "uat", "preview", "eu-prd", "us-prd"

### Organization-Level vs. Project-Level Environments

Traceloop supports two types of environments:

**Organization-Level Environments**
- Created at the organization settings level
- Automatically cascade to **all projects** (existing and new)
- Use this for environments that apply across your entire organization

**Project-Specific Environments**
- Created within a single project
- Only appear in that specific project
- Use this for project-specific deployment stages

<Tip>
  **Best practice:** Create organization-level environments for company-wide deployment stages
  (dev, stg, prd, qa). Create project-specific environments only when needed
  for unique deployment scenarios.
</Tip>

### How Environment Cascading Works

When you create an organization-level environment:
1. It immediately appears in all existing projects
2. It automatically appears in any new projects you create
3. Each project can independently generate API keys for that environment

**Example:**
```
Organization creates "QA" environment
  ↓
Appears in "web-app" project (can generate its own QA API key)
Appears in "api-service" project (can generate its own QA API key)
Appears in "mobile-app" project (can generate its own QA API key)
```

## Setting Up Projects and Environments

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Settings">
Go to **Settings** in your Traceloop dashboard, then select the **Organization** tab.

You'll see two sections:
- **Projects and API keys**: Manage your projects
- **Organization environments**: Manage org-wide environments
</Step>

<Step title="Create a Project (Optional)">
If you need a new project:

1. Click the **+** button next to "Projects and API keys"
2. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "web-app", "payment-service", "mobile-app")
3. Click **Create**

The project is created instantly with all organization-level environments included.

<Note>
  A "Default project" is created automatically when you sign up.
  You can rename or delete it if needed.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Create Custom Environments (Optional)">
If you need additional environments beyond dev, stg, and prd:

**For organization-wide environments:**
1. Click the **+** button next to "Organization environments"
2. Enter an environment name (e.g., "qa", "preview", "eu-prd")
3. Click **Create**
4. The environment appears in all projects immediately

**For project-specific environments:**
1. Click on your project
2. Click the **+** button next to "Project environments"
3. Enter an environment name
4. Click **Create**
5. The environment appears only in this project

<Tip>
  An environment **slug** is automatically created for SDK usage. For example,
  "EU Production" becomes "eu-production" as the slug. The default environments
  use "dev", "stg", and "prd" as their slugs.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Generate API Keys">
API keys are generated per project + environment:

1. Click on your project
2. Find the environment you want to use
3. Click **Generate API key**
4. Copy the key immediately (it won't be shown again)
5. Use it in your application as `TRACELOOP_API_KEY`

See [Managing API Keys](/settings/managing-api-keys) for detailed instructions.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Viewing Your Data

### Switching Between Projects

The Traceloop dashboard shows **one project at a time**. To switch projects:

1. Click the project dropdown from the main menu on the left-hand side of the dashboard
2. Select the project you want to view
3. All traces, datasets, and other data will update to show only that project

<Note>
  You cannot view multiple projects simultaneously. This is by design to maintain
  clear data isolation and prevent confusion.
</Note>

### Filtering by Environment

Within a project, you can filter data by environment:

1. Select your project from the dropdown
2. Use the environment filter to show only specific environments
3. This filters traces, monitors, and other real-time data by environment

## Managing Projects and Environments

### Renaming

**Projects**: Can be renamed at any time
- Click on the project → Settings → Rename

**Environments**: Cannot be renamed
- Delete and recreate if needed (see warnings below)

### Deleting Projects

<Warning>
  **Deleting a project is permanent and irreversible.**

  When you delete a project:
  - All traces and spans are permanently deleted
  - All datasets and their versions are lost
  - All prompts, evaluators, and experiments are removed
  - All API keys for that project are revoked

  **There is no way to recover this data.**
</Warning>

To delete a project:
1. Click on the project
2. Go to project settings
3. Click **Delete project**
4. Confirm the deletion

### Deleting Environments

<Warning>
  **Deleting an environment is permanent and irreversible.**

  When you delete an environment:
  - All traces for that environment are permanently deleted
  - The API key is revoked immediately
  - Applications using that key will stop sending data

  **There is no way to recover this data.**

  To delete a project:
1. Click on the project
2. Go to project settings
3. Click **Delete project**
4. Confirm the deletion

</Warning>

**Organization-level environments:**
- Cannot delete the three default environments (dev, stg, prd)
- Can delete custom organization-level environments
- Deleting removes the environment from all projects

**Project-specific environments:**
- Can delete any project-specific environment
- Only affects that specific project

### Limitations and Permissions

**Current limitations:**
- ❌ Cannot move or copy data between projects
- ❌ Cannot merge projects
- ❌ Cannot transfer datasets or prompts between projects
- ❌ No per-project access control (everyone in the organization can see all projects)

**What you can do:**
- ✅ Create unlimited projects and environments
- ✅ Rename projects (but not environments)
- ✅ Everyone in your organization can manage all projects and API keys

## Best Practices

### Project Organization

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="By Application" icon="layer-group">
    Create one project per application or major service.

    **Example:**
    - "web-app" (frontend)
    - "api-gateway" (backend)
    - "auth-service" (microservice)
  </Card>

  <Card title="By Team" icon="users">
    Create projects based on team ownership.

    **Example:**
    - "checkout-team"
    - "recommendations-team"
    - "infrastructure-team"
  </Card>

  <Card title="By Product Line" icon="box">
    Separate different products or customer segments.

    **Example:**
    - "consumer-app"
    - "enterprise-app"
    - "internal-tools"
  </Card>

  <Card title="By Environment Type" icon="globe">
    For complex deployments with regional separation.

    **Example:**
    - "app-us-production"
    - "app-eu-production"
    - "app-asia-production"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Environment Strategy

**Use built-in environments for standard workflows:**
```
dev  → Local development and unit testing
stg  → Integration testing and QA
prd  → Live customer traffic
```

**Add custom environments for special cases:**
```
qa       → Dedicated QA team testing
preview  → Preview deployments for each PR
canary   → Canary deployments before full rollout
eu-prd   → Regional production environments
```

### Naming Conventions

**Projects:**
- Use descriptive, lowercase names with hyphens
- Include the service or application name
- Examples: `payment-api`, `mobile-app`, `ml-inference`

**Environments:**
- Keep names short and clear
- Use standard terms when possible
- Examples: `dev`, `stg`, `prd`, `qa`, `preview`

## Common Scenarios

### Microservices Architecture

Create one project per microservice:

```
Projects:
├── api-gateway (dev, stg, prd environments)
├── auth-service (dev, stg, prd environments)
├── payment-service (dev, stg, prd environments)
└── notification-service (dev, stg, prd environments)
```

Each service has its own API keys per environment, keeping traces completely isolated.

### Monorepo with Multiple Apps

Create projects per deployable application:

```
Projects:
├── web-frontend (dev, stg, prd)
├── mobile-backend (dev, stg, prd)
└── admin-dashboard (dev, stg, prd)
```

### Multi-Region Deployment

Option 1: Use custom environments per region within one project:

```
Project: global-app
Environments:
├── dev
├── stg
├── us-prd
├── eu-prd
└── apac-prd
```

Option 2: Use separate projects per region:

```
Projects:
├── app-us (dev, stg, prd)
├── app-eu (dev, stg, prd)
└── app-apac (dev, stg, prd)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Can't See My Project in Dashboard

**Problem:** Created a project but it doesn't appear in the dropdown.

**Solutions:**
- Refresh the page
- Check if you're logged into the correct organization
- Verify the project wasn't deleted

### Data Appearing in Wrong Project

**Problem:** Traces showing up in unexpected project.

**Solutions:**
- Verify which API key you're using: `echo $TRACELOOP_API_KEY`
- Check which project + environment the API key belongs to
- Ensure you haven't accidentally used the wrong key in your configuration

### Need to Move Data Between Projects

**Problem:** Want to transfer datasets or traces to a different project.

**Solution:**
- Data cannot be moved between projects (this is a security/isolation feature)
- For datasets: Export as CSV and import into the new project
- For traces: Cannot be transferred (must regenerate in new project)

### Accidentally Deleted Environment

**Problem:** Deleted an environment and lost data.

**Solution:**
- Unfortunately, there is no way to recover deleted data
- Prevention: Always confirm before deleting
- Best practice: Back up critical datasets regularly
