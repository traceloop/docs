API keys are required to authenticate your application with Traceloop. Each API key is tied to a specific project and environment combination, determining where your traces and data will appear.

## Quick Start: Generate Your First API Key

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Settings">
Go to [Settings → Organization](https://app.traceloop.com/settings/api-keys) in your Traceloop dashboard.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Your Project">
Click on the project where you want to generate an API key (e.g., "Default project").

If you haven't created a project yet, see [Projects and Environments](/settings/projects-and-environments).
</Step>

<Step title="Generate API Key for an Environment">
Find the environment you want to use (Development, Staging, or Production) and click **Generate API key**.

<Warning>
  **Copy the API key immediately!** The full key is only shown once and cannot be retrieved later.
  After you close or reload the page, you'll need to revoke and generate a new key if you lose it.
</Warning>

The key will be displayed partially masked, but you can copy the full key using the copy button.
</Step>

<Step title="Set as Environment Variable">
Export the API key in your application:

```bash
export TRACELOOP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Or set it in your `.env` file:

```bash
TRACELOOP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
</Step>
</Steps>

Done! Your application can now send traces and access Traceloop features.

## Understanding API Keys

### How API Keys Work

Each API key is scoped to a specific **project + environment** combination:
- **Project**: Isolates data for different applications or services (e.g., "web-app", "api-service")
- **Environment**: Separates deployment stages (Development, Staging, Production)

When you use an API key, the SDK automatically knows where to send your data based on the key itself.

**Example:**
- API key from "web-app" → "Development" sends traces to the "web-app" project's Development environment
- API key from "api-service" → "Production" sends traces to the "api-service" project's Production environment

### Viewing Your Data

To see your traces in the dashboard:
1. Select the correct **project** from the project dropdown
2. Filter by **environment** if needed

<Tip>
  **Not seeing your traces?** Make sure you're viewing the same project and environment
  that matches your API key.
</Tip>

## Common Scenarios

### Local Development

Use your Development environment API key:

```bash
# In your .env or shell
export TRACELOOP_API_KEY=your_development_key
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

Use Staging or Production keys in your deployment configuration:

```yaml
# Example: GitHub Actions
env:
  TRACELOOP_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.TRACELOOP_STAGING_KEY }}
```

```yaml
# Example: Docker Compose
environment:
  - TRACELOOP_API_KEY=${TRACELOOP_PRODUCTION_KEY}
```

### Multiple Projects from One Application

If you need to send data to different projects from the same codebase, pass the API key directly in code instead of using environment variables:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from traceloop.sdk import Traceloop

# Initialize with specific API key
Traceloop.init(api_key="your_project_specific_key")
```

```javascript TypeScript / JavaScript
import * as traceloop from "@traceloop/node-server-sdk";

// Initialize with specific API key
traceloop.initialize({
  apiKey: "your_project_specific_key"
});
```

```go Go
import "github.com/traceloop/go-sdk/traceloop"

// Initialize with specific API key
traceloop.Init(traceloop.Config{
  APIKey: "your_project_specific_key",
})
```
</CodeGroup>

### Multiple Environments from One Application

Similar to multiple projects, pass different keys for different environments:

```python
import os

environment = os.getenv("APP_ENV", "development")
api_keys = {
    "development": "dev_api_key",
    "staging": "staging_api_key",
    "production": "prod_api_key"
}

Traceloop.init(api_key=api_keys[environment])
```

## Managing Your API Keys

### Revoking an API Key

If your API key is compromised or you need to rotate keys:

1. Go to Settings → Organization → Select your project
2. Find the environment with the key you want to revoke
3. Click **Revoke API key**
4. Generate a new key immediately
5. Update your application configuration with the new key

<Warning>
  Revoking a key immediately stops all applications using it from sending data.
  Make sure to update your configuration before revoking production keys.
</Warning>

### Lost Your API Key?

If you lose your API key and didn't save it:

1. You **cannot** retrieve the original key
2. You must **revoke** the old key and **generate** a new one
3. Update your application with the new key

This is a security feature - API keys are never stored in retrievable form.

### Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use Secret Management" icon="key">
    Store API keys in secret management systems like AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault,
    HashiCorp Vault, or 1Password instead of hardcoding them.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Rotate Keys Regularly" icon="rotate">
    Periodically rotate your API keys, especially for production environments.
    Schedule key rotation as part of your security practices.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Separate Keys Per Environment" icon="layer-group">
    Never use production API keys in development or staging.
    This prevents accidental data mixing and security risks.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Limit Key Exposure" icon="eye-slash">
    Don't commit API keys to version control. Use environment variables
    or secret management systems instead.
  </Card>

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Failed

**Problem:** Getting authentication errors when initializing the SDK.

**Solutions:**
- Verify the API key is correctly set as `TRACELOOP_API_KEY`
- Check if the key has been revoked (generate a new one if needed)
- Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters in the key

### Not Seeing Traces

**Problem:** Application runs but traces don't appear in dashboard.

**Solutions:**
- Confirm you're viewing the correct **project** in the dashboard dropdown
- Check you're filtering by the correct **environment**
- Verify the API key matches the project + environment you're viewing
- Check SDK initialization logs for connection errors

### Wrong Data Appearing

**Problem:** Seeing unexpected traces or data in your project.

**Solutions:**
- Double-check which API key you're using (`echo $TRACELOOP_API_KEY`)
- Verify the API key belongs to the intended project + environment
- Check if other team members are using the same project

### Multiple Applications Sending to Same Project

**Problem:** Want to separate data from different services but they're in the same project.

**Solutions:**
- Create a separate project for each application/service
- Generate unique API keys for each project
- See [Projects and Environments](/settings/projects-and-environments) for more details
