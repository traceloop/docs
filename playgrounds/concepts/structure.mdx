# Playground Structure

A playground is organized as a table-like structure with three fundamental components: **rows**, **columns**, and **cells**. Understanding how these work together is essential for effective playground usage.

## Rows

Rows represent individual **data points** or **test cases** in your playground. Each row is a complete record that spans across all columns.

### Row Characteristics
- **Independent**: Each row can be executed independently
- **Ordered**: Rows maintain their order and can be reordered as needed
- **Identifiable**: Each row has a unique ID for tracking and references

### Row Operations
- **Add Row**: Create new rows manually or through bulk operations
- **Delete Row**: Remove unwanted rows individually or in bulk
- **Duplicate Row**: Copy existing rows to create variations
- **Reorder Rows**: Drag and drop to change row order
- **Generate Rows**: Use AI to generate multiple similar rows based on patterns

### Example: Customer Support Analysis
```
Row 1: Customer: "Alice", Issue: "Login problem", Priority: "High"
Row 2: Customer: "Bob", Issue: "Billing question", Priority: "Medium"  
Row 3: Customer: "Carol", Issue: "Feature request", Priority: "Low"
```

## Columns

Columns define the **data types** and **operations** in your playground. Each column has a specific type that determines how it behaves and what kind of data it can contain or generate.

### Column Categories

**Data Input Columns**
- Store static data entered manually or imported
- Examples: Custom Text, Numeric, Boolean, Select options

**Computation Columns**  
- Perform operations using data from other columns
- Examples: Prompts (LLM calls), Code (Python execution), API calls

**Evaluation Columns**
- Assess and score data from other columns
- Examples: Built-in evaluators, Custom evaluators, Manual labels

**Import Columns**
- Bring in data from external sources
- Examples: Trace data, Dataset imports

### Column Configuration
Each column has:
- **Name**: Descriptive identifier used for references
- **Type**: Determines functionality and available options
- **Settings**: Type-specific configuration options
- **Description**: Optional documentation for team collaboration

### Column Dependencies
Columns can reference other columns, creating **dependency chains**:
```
Customer Name → Personalized Greeting → Helpfulness Score
     ↓                    ↓                    ↓
  Input Data      →    Prompt Column    →  Evaluation
```

## Cells

Cells are the intersection of rows and columns, containing the actual **data** or **computation results**.

### Cell States
Each cell has a status that indicates its current state:

**Static States**
- **Empty**: No data present
- **Filled**: Contains static data (input columns)

**Execution States**  
- **Pending**: Queued for execution
- **Running**: Currently being processed (shows spinner)
- **Completed**: Successfully executed (green checkmark)
- **Failed**: Execution failed (red X with error details)
- **Outdated**: Source data changed, needs re-execution (orange warning)

### Cell Types by Column

**Input Cells**
- Contain manually entered or imported data
- Can be edited directly by clicking
- Support various data types (text, numbers, JSON, etc.)

**Computed Cells**
- Generated by column execution (prompts, code, APIs)
- Cannot be edited directly
- Update automatically when dependencies change

**Evaluation Cells**
- Contain scores, labels, or assessment results
- May include confidence scores and explanations
- Can be manual (annotation) or automated (evaluators)

## Data Model & Relationships

### Internal Structure
```
Playground
├── Metadata (name, description, created_at, etc.)
├── Columns []
│   ├── Column Definition (type, settings, dependencies)
│   └── Column Data (all cell values for this column)
└── Rows []
    ├── Row Metadata (id, order, created_at)
    └── Row Data (cell values across all columns)
```

### References & Variables
Columns can reference each other using the variable syntax:
- `{{Column Name}}` - References another column's value in the same row
- Variables resolve at execution time
- Circular references are detected and prevented
- Multiple variables can be used in a single column

### Example Variable Usage
```
Column 1: "Customer Name" → "Alice Johnson"
Column 2: "Email Template" → "Hello {{Customer Name}}, welcome to our service!"
Result: "Hello Alice Johnson, welcome to our service!"
```

## Playground Lifecycle

### 1. Creation
- Start empty or import from existing data
- Configure initial columns and structure
- Set up basic dependencies

### 2. Development
- Add rows and columns iteratively
- Test execution with sample data
- Refine prompts and evaluations

### 3. Execution
- Run computations across all or selected cells
- Monitor progress and handle failures
- Review and validate results

### 4. Analysis
- Use built-in analytics and insights
- Export results for further analysis
- Share findings with team members

## Best Practices

### Structure Design
- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic input and output columns
- **Logical Flow**: Organize columns in dependency order
- **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive column names for easy reference
- **Consistent Data**: Ensure row data follows consistent patterns

### Performance Optimization
- **Batch Operations**: Process multiple rows simultaneously when possible
- **Selective Execution**: Only re-run cells that need updates
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize unnecessary column dependencies
- **Resource Limits**: Be mindful of API rate limits and execution timeouts

### Collaboration
- **Documentation**: Add descriptions to complex columns
- **Version Control**: Use playground export/import for backup
- **Access Control**: Understand sharing and permission settings
- **Change Management**: Communicate structural changes to team members
