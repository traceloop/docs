# Evaluation System

The evaluation system is a core feature of Traceloop playgrounds, providing comprehensive tools to assess LLM outputs, data quality, and performance across various dimensions. Whether you need automated scoring or human judgment, the evaluation system has you covered.

## Overview

The evaluation system consists of:
- **[Built-in Evaluators](./built-in/)** - 13+ pre-configured evaluators for common assessment tasks
- **[Evaluation Columns](./columns/)** - Column types that perform evaluation operations  
- **[Custom Evaluators](./custom/)** - User-defined LLM-powered evaluation logic
- **[Annotation System](./annotation/)** - Manual labeling and human judgment workflows

## Evaluation Categories

### üéØ **Quality Evaluators**

- **[Helpfulness](./built-in/helpfulness)** - How helpful is the response to the user?
- **[Coherence](./built-in/coherence)** - Is the response logically consistent?
- **[Correctness](./built-in/correctness)** - Factual accuracy and reliability
- **[Relevancy](./built-in/relevancy)** - How relevant is the response to the input?

### üõ°Ô∏è **Safety Evaluators**

## Evaluation Column Types

### [Evaluation Column](./columns/evaluation)
Uses built-in evaluators to automatically score content:
- Select from 13+ pre-configured evaluators
- Configurable scoring scales and criteria
- Batch evaluation across multiple rows
- Confidence scores and explanations

### [Custom Evaluator Column](./columns/custom-evaluator)
Create your own LLM-powered evaluation logic:
- Design custom evaluation criteria
- Use flexible prompt templates
- Incorporate domain-specific knowledge
- Generate detailed evaluation explanations

### [Label Column](./columns/label)
Manual annotation and human judgment:
- Various question types (rating, multiple choice, text)
- Collaborative annotation workflows
- Inter-annotator agreement tracking
- Integration with automated evaluations

## Getting Started with Evaluation

### Step 1: Choose Your Evaluation Approach

**For Standard Metrics**
Use built-in evaluators for common assessment tasks:
```
Add Evaluation Column ‚Üí Select "Helpfulness" ‚Üí Configure target column
```

**For Custom Criteria**
Create custom evaluators for specific needs:
```
Add Custom Evaluator ‚Üí Define evaluation prompt ‚Üí Set scoring criteria
```

**For Human Judgment**
Use manual annotation for subjective assessments:
```
Add Label Column ‚Üí Design annotation interface ‚Üí Assign to reviewers
```

### Step 2: Configure Evaluation Parameters

**Scoring Scale**
- 1-5 scale for quick assessments
- 1-10 scale for detailed scoring
- Binary (pass/fail) for threshold decisions
- Custom scales for specific needs

**Evaluation Criteria**
- Define what you're measuring
- Provide clear guidelines for consistency
- Include examples of good/bad outputs
- Set expectations for edge cases

### Step 3: Execute and Analyze

**Batch Execution**
- Run evaluations across all rows simultaneously
- Monitor progress with real-time updates
- Handle failures and retries automatically
- Export results for further analysis

**Results Analysis**
- View score distributions and patterns
- Identify outliers and edge cases
- Generate summary statistics
- Create evaluation reports

## Best Practices

### Evaluation Design
