# Playgrounds

Playgrounds are interactive, spreadsheet-like environments where you can experiment with LLMs, evaluate outputs, and analyze data in real-time. Think of them as powerful workbenches for AI development that combine the flexibility of a spreadsheet with the power of LLM evaluation and execution.

## What are Playgrounds?

A Playground is a structured workspace consisting of:
- **Rows**: Individual data points or test cases
- **Columns**: Different types of data, computations, or evaluations
- **Cells**: The intersection of rows and columns containing your actual data

Each Playground supports real-time collaboration, asynchronous execution, and sophisticated evaluation workflows.

## Key Use Cases

### üß™ **Prompt Engineering & Testing**
- Test prompts across multiple examples simultaneously
- Compare different prompt variations side-by-side
- Iterate on prompt templates with immediate feedback

### üìä **LLM Output Evaluation**
- Run systematic evaluations using built-in evaluators
- Create custom evaluation criteria with LLM-powered judges
- Compare model performance across different metrics

### üîç **Data Analysis & Exploration**
- Import production traces and spans for analysis
- Extract insights from conversational data
- Perform batch operations on large datasets

### üèóÔ∏è **Experimentation**
- Set up controlled experiments with different configurations
- A/B test different approaches systematically
- Generate comprehensive reports and analytics

## Core Features

### **15 Column Types**
Playgrounds support 15 different column types organized into categories:
- **Data Input**: Text, numeric, boolean, select, multi-select, JSON
- **Computation**: Prompts, code execution, API calls, metadata extraction
- **Evaluation**: Built-in evaluators, custom evaluators, manual labeling
- **Import**: Source data from traces, imported datasets

### **Async Execution System**
- Execute individual cells, entire rows, or the whole playground
- Real-time status updates during execution
- Dependency management between columns
- Resume failed or interrupted executions

### **Rich Import/Export**
- Import from JSON, CSV files with intelligent column mapping
- Connect to existing datasets and dataset versions
- Import production traces and spans directly
- Export results for further analysis or reporting

### **Advanced Evaluation**
- 13+ built-in evaluators for common LLM evaluation tasks
- Custom LLM-powered evaluators with flexible templates  
- Manual annotation workflows with various question types
- AI-generated insights and analytics

## Integration with Traceloop

Playgrounds integrate seamlessly with other Traceloop features:
- **Datasets**: Import data from and export results to datasets
- **Experiments**: Use playground configurations to run large-scale experiments
- **Prompts**: Test and iterate on prompt templates
- **Traces**: Analyze production data by importing traces and spans
