# Getting Started with Playgrounds

This guide will walk you through creating your first playground and understanding the basic concepts. By the end, you'll have a working playground with multiple column types and understand how to execute and evaluate data.

## Creating Your First Playground

### Step 1: Navigate to Playgrounds

1. Go to your project dashboard
2. Click on **"Playgrounds"** in the navigation menu
3. Click **"Create Playground"** button

### Step 2: Choose Your Starting Point

You have several options to start your playground:

**Start Fresh**
- Creates an empty playground where you can add columns manually
- Best for custom workflows and experimentation

**Import from File**
- Upload a JSON or CSV file
- Automatically maps columns based on your data
- Great for analyzing existing datasets

**Import from Dataset**
- Use an existing Traceloop dataset
- Select specific versions for analysis
- Maintains data lineage and versioning

**Import from Production**
- Import traces and spans from your production environment
- Analyze real user interactions and model performance
- Perfect for debugging and optimization

For this guide, we'll **start fresh** to understand the core concepts.

## Understanding the Interface

Once you create a playground, you'll see:

### Header Section
- **Playground name**: Click to rename your playground
- **Progress indicator**: Shows execution progress when running operations
- **Execute All**: Runs all executable columns in the playground  
- **Add Column**: Creates new columns of different types
- **Analytics**: View AI-generated insights (if enabled)
- **Actions**: Additional options like export, duplicate, delete

### Main Table
- **Rows**: Horizontal entries representing your data points
- **Columns**: Vertical sections with different data types and functionality
- **Cells**: Individual intersections containing your data
- **Status indicators**: Show execution state (pending, running, completed, failed)

## Building Your First Playground

Let's create a simple playground for testing different greeting prompts:

### Step 3: Add Input Data

1. Click **"Add Column"** 
2. Select **"Custom Text"** column type
3. Name it "Customer Name"
4. Click **"Create Column"**

Now add some sample data:
- Click the first cell under "Customer Name"
- Enter: "Alice Johnson"
- Press Enter and add: "Bob Smith"  
- Add: "Carol Davis"

### Step 4: Add a Prompt Column

1. Click **"Add Column"** again
2. Select **"Prompt"** column type
3. Name it "Greeting Prompt"
4. Configure the prompt:
   ```
   Write a personalized greeting for {{Customer Name}}. 
   Make it warm and professional.
   ```
5. Select your preferred model (e.g., GPT-4)
6. Set temperature to 0.7 for creative but consistent results
7. Click **"Create Column"**

### Step 5: Add Evaluation

1. Click **"Add Column"**
2. Select **"Evaluation"** column type  
3. Name it "Helpfulness Score"
4. Choose **"Helpfulness"** as the evaluator
5. Configure it to evaluate the "Greeting Prompt" column
6. Click **"Create Column"**

### Step 6: Execute Your Playground

1. Click **"Execute All"** in the header
2. Watch as each column executes in order:
   - Input columns (already filled) âœ…
   - Prompt column generates greetings ðŸ”„
   - Evaluation column scores the results ðŸ”„

You'll see real-time status updates as each cell processes.

## Understanding Execution

### Execution Order
Columns execute based on their dependencies:
1. **Input columns** (Custom Text, Numeric, etc.) - No execution needed
2. **Computation columns** (Prompts, Code, API) - Execute based on inputs
3. **Evaluation columns** - Execute after the columns they evaluate

### Cell Status States
Each cell shows its current state:
- **Empty**: No data or pending execution
- **Running**: Currently being processed (animated spinner)  
- **Completed**: Successfully executed (green checkmark)
- **Failed**: Execution failed (red X with error details)
- **Outdated**: Input changed, needs re-execution (orange indicator)

### Selective Execution
You don't always need to execute everything:
- **Single cell**: Click the execute button in any cell
- **Entire row**: Click the row execute button
- **Specific columns**: Use column-level execution options

## Working with Variables

Notice how we used `{{Customer Name}}` in our prompt. This is Traceloop's variable system:

- Variables reference other columns by name
- Use double curly braces: `{{Column Name}}`
- Variables update automatically when source data changes
- You can reference multiple columns in a single prompt

Example advanced prompt:
```
Hello {{Customer Name}}, 

Based on your profile: {{Customer Profile}}
And recent activity: {{Recent Activity}}

Here's a personalized recommendation...
```

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've created your first playground. Here's what to explore next:

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Add more data**: Try adding more customer names and see how results vary
2. **Experiment with prompts**: Modify your prompt and re-execute
3. **Try different evaluators**: Add columns for "Relevancy" or "Coherence"
4. **Export your results**: Use the Actions menu to export as CSV or JSON

- [Column Types](./columns/) - Explore all 15 column types available
- [Evaluation System](./evaluation/) - Master built-in and custom evaluators  
- [Data Management](./data/) - Import/export and dataset integration

### Common Patterns
- **A/B Testing**: Create multiple prompt columns to compare approaches
- **Batch Processing**: Import large datasets and process them systematically
- **Quality Assurance**: Set up evaluation pipelines for model outputs
- **Data Analysis**: Use code columns for complex data transformations

## Tips for Success

### Performance
- Start small and scale up gradually
- Use selective execution during development
- Monitor execution progress for long-running operations

### Organization  
- Use descriptive column names that indicate their purpose
- Group related columns together
- Document complex prompts and code in column descriptions

### Collaboration
- Playgrounds support real-time collaboration
- Use comments and descriptions to communicate with team members
- Export results for sharing with stakeholders
