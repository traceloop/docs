Playgrounds are interactive spreadsheets where you can organize your data and experiment with LLMs, evaluate outputs, and analyze data. 
Think of them as powerful workbenches for AI development that combine the flexibility of a spreadsheet with the power of LLM evaluation and execution.
Itâ€™s designed for everyone, from product managers and analysts to QA, data engineers, and software developers.

## Playground Structure

A playground is organized as a table-like structure with three fundamental components: **rows**, **columns**, and **cells**. Understanding how these work together is essential for effective playground usage.

### Rows

Rows represent individual **data points** or **test cases** in your playground. Each row is a complete record that spans across all columns.
Each row in the Playground is independent and can be executed on its own, maintains an order that can be rearranged as needed.

### Row Operations
- **Add Row**: Create new rows manually or through bulk operations
- **Generate Rows**: Use the AI row generator to create new rows based on the existing data in your Playground.
- **Delete Row**: Remove unwanted rows individually or in bulk
- **Execute Row**: Execute all cells in a specific row

## Columns

Columns are the building blocks of playgrounds, defining what kind of data you can store, process, and analyze. They come in different types to handle various data formats and use cases:

**Data Input Columns** store static data such as text, json, numbers and tags

**Prompt Columns** execute LLM prompts directly on your data with full model configuration, allowing you to test different prompts and compare outputs side by side.

**Evaluation Columns** assess AI outputs and data quality using pre-built evaluators or custom evaluators tailored to your specific needs. Learn more about [evaluators](../evaluators/intro).

You can manage columns by reordering, hiding, editing, duplicating, or deleting them as your analysis evolves. Learn more about [column types](./columns/data-columns) and [column management](./columns/column-management).

## Create a Playground

Data can be imported from different sources: 

1. CSV files
2. JSON file
3. From A Dataset
4. From production spans

You can create a Playground from scratch and import data later. Simply set a name for the Playground and start adding columns, rows, and data.
