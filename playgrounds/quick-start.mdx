Playgrounds are interactive spreadsheet where you can organize your data and experiment with LLMs, evaluate outputs, and analyze data. 
Think of them as powerful workbenches for AI development that combine the flexibility of a spreadsheet with the power of LLM evaluation and execution.
Itâ€™s designed for everyone, from product managers and analysts to QA, data engineers, and software developers.

## Playground Structure

A playground is organized as a table-like structure with three fundamental components: **rows**, **columns**, and **cells**. Understanding how these work together is essential for effective playground usage.

### Rows

Rows represent individual **data points** or **test cases** in your playground. Each row is a complete record that spans across all columns.

### Row Characteristics
Each row in the Playground is independent and can be executed on its own, maintains an order that can be rearranged as needed.

### Row Operations
- **Add Row**: Create new rows manually or through bulk operations
- **Delete Row**: Remove unwanted rows individually or in bulk
- **Duplicate Row**: Copy existing rows to create variations
- **Reorder Rows**: Drag and drop to change row order
- **Generate Rows**: Use AI to generate multiple similar rows based on patterns

## Create A Playground

Data can be imported from different sources: 

1. CSV files
2. JSON file
3. From A Dataset
4. From production spans

You can create a Playground from scratch and import data later. Simply set a name for the Playground and start adding columns, rows, and data.
