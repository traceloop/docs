title: "Data Columns"

Columns are the building blocks of playgrounds, defining what kind of data you can store, process, and analyze.

## üìù Data Input Columns
Store and manage static data entered manually or imported from external sources.

### Text field
Free-form text input with multiline support

### Numeric
Numbers, integers, and floating-point values

/>
<img 
  className="hidden dark:block" 
  src="/img/playground/play-number-col-dark.png"
  style={{maxWidth: '300px'}}
/>

The last row allows you to choose a calculation method for the column, such as average, median, minimum, maximum, or sum.

### Single select
Single-choice columns let you define a set of predefined options and restrict each cell to one selection. 
To create one, set the column name and add options in the Create Column drawer. 
In the values box, type an option and press Enter to save it‚Äîonce added, it will appear as a colored label.

In the table, each cell will then allow you to select only one of the defined options.
This column type is especially useful for manual tagging with a single tag.

<img 
  className="hidden dark:block" 
  src="/img/playground/play-single-select-dark.png"
/>


### Multi select
Multi-select columns let you define a set of predefined options and allow each cell to contain multiple selections. The setup process is the same as for single-select columns: define the column name, add options in the Create Column drawer, and save them as labels.

In the table, each cell can then include several of the defined options. This column type is especially useful for manual tagging with multiple tags.

/>


### JSON
A JSON column allows you to store and edit structured JSON objects directly in the Playground. Each cell can contain a JSON value, making it easy to work with complex data structures.

When editing a cell, an Edit JSON panel opens with syntax highlighting and formatting support, so you can quickly add or update fields.
