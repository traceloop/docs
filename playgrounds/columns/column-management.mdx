Columns in the Playground can be reordered, edited, or deleted at any time to adapt your workspace as your analysis evolves. Understanding how to manage columns effectively helps you maintain organized and efficient playgrounds.

## Columns Settings
Column Settings lets you hide specific columns from the Playground and reorder them as needed. To open the settings, click the Playground Action button and select Column Settings

/>
<img className="hidden dark:block" src="/img/playground/play-action-dark.png" />

To change the column order, use the six-dot handle on the right side of each column to simply drag the column into the desired position. 

To hide a column, toggle its switch in the menu.

## Columns Actions

Each column has a menu that lets you manage and customize it. From this menu, you can:
- Rename the column directly by editing its title
- Edit the column configuration
- Duplicate the column to create a copy with the same settings
- Delete the column if itâ€™s no longer needed
