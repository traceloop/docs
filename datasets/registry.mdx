Traceloop's Dataset Registry is where you manage your test datasets. You can create, edit, version, and organize datasets for systematic testing and evaluation of your AI applications.

## Creating and Managing Datasets

A dataset in Traceloop consists of:

- **Structured data**: Rows and columns organized in a table format
- **Column types**: Text, Number, or Boolean fields to match your data needs
- **Version control**: Track changes and maintain stable snapshots

<Tip>
  Think of datasets like spreadsheets specifically designed for AI testing.
  Each row represents a test case, and each column represents a different
  input variable or expected output.
</Tip>

Initially, datasets are created in `Draft Mode`. In this mode, you can freely add, edit, and remove data. You can also modify the dataset structure by adding or removing columns.

## Working with Dataset Structure

### Column Types

Traceloop supports three column types to match different data needs:

- **Text**: For prompts, responses, names, descriptions, or any textual content
- **Number**: For scores, metrics, quantities, or numerical values  
- **Boolean**: For flags, binary classifications, or true/false values

### Adding and Editing Data

You can populate your dataset in several ways:

1. **Manual entry**: Click on cells to directly input data
2. **Copy and paste**: Import data from spreadsheets or other sources
3. **Bulk operations**: Use fill handles to quickly populate similar data

The interface provides Excel-like functionality including:
- Cell selection and range operations
- Column resizing and reordering
- Row addition and deletion
- Undo/redo operations

## Dataset Versions and Publishing

Draft mode datasets are mutable and perfect for iterative development. When you're ready to create a stable snapshot:

1. **Publish a version**: Click the "Publish Version" button
2. **Add metadata**: Provide a version description and release notes
3. **Lock the version**: Published versions become immutable

Once published, the dataset version cannot be edited anymore, ensuring reproducible testing.

Navigate to the `Versions` tab to see all published versions of your dataset. Here you can:

- View version history and metadata
- Compare different versions
- Revert to previous versions by creating new datasets
- Delete unused versions

<Note>
  Published versions are recommended for production testing and CI/CD pipelines
  since they provide consistency and reproducibility across test runs.
</Note>

## Dataset Organization

### Naming Conventions

Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the dataset's purpose:

- `customer_support_scenarios`
- `product_description_generation`  
- `sentiment_analysis_validation`
- `multilingual_translation_tests`

### Access Control

Datasets inherit the access permissions of their parent project. Team members with project access can:

- View and edit draft datasets
- Create new versions
- Use datasets in their testing workflows

## Integration with Playgrounds

Datasets can be seamlessly integrated with Traceloop Playgrounds for interactive testing:

1. **Import dataset**: Load any published dataset version into a playground
2. **Run experiments**: Execute your prompts against the entire dataset
3. **Analyze results**: Compare outputs and identify patterns
4. **Export results**: Save experimental results back as new datasets

<Warning>
  When importing a dataset into a playground, make sure the column names
  match the variables expected by your prompts. Mismatched column names
  will result in empty variable substitutions.
</Warning>
