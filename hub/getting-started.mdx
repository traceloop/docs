---

Hub is a next generation smart proxy for LLM applications. It centralizes control and tracing of all LLM calls and traces.
It's built in Rust so it's fast and efficient. It's completely open-source and free to use.

## Installation

### Local

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/traceloop/hub
```

2. Copy the `config-example.yaml` file to `config.yaml` and set the correct values (see below for more information).

3. Run the hub by running `cargo run` in the root directory.

### With Docker

Traceloop Hub is available as a docker image.

```bash
docker build . -t hub
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd)/config.yaml:/etc/config.yaml:ro -t hub
```

## Connecting to Hub

After running the hub and [configuring it](./configuration.mdx), you can start using it to invoke available LLM providers.
Its API is the standard OpenAI API, so you can use it as a drop-in replacement for your LLM calls.

You can invoke different pipelines by passing the `x-traceloop-pipeline` header. If none is specified, the default pipeline will be used.

```python
import openai

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:3000/api/v1",
    # default_headers={"x-traceloop-pipeline": "optional-pipeline-name"},
)
```
