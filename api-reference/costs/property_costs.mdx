Query your LLM costs broken down by a specific association property. This helps you understand how costs are distributed across different values of a property (e.g., by user_id, session_id, or any other association property you track).

## Request Parameters

<ParamField query="property_name" type="string" required>
  The name of the association property to group costs by (e.g., "user_id", "session_id").
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="start_time" type="string" required>
  The start time in ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2025-04-15T00:00:00Z").
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="end_time" type="string" required>
  The end time in ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2025-04-28T23:00:00Z").
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="env" type="string">
  List of environments to include in the calculation. Separated by comma.
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="property_name" type="string">
  The name of the property that was queried.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="values" type="PropertyValue[]">
  A list of property values and their associated costs.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="total_cost" type="number">
  The total cost across all property values.
</ResponseField>

```json
{
  "property_name": "session_id",
  "values": [
    {
      "value": "session_21",
      "cost": 1.23
    },
    {
      "value": "session_5",
      "cost": 4.56
    },
    {
      "value": "No_Value",
      "cost": 0.78

  "total_cost": 6.57
}
```

The API can return special values:
- `"No_Association"` as property_name if no spans have the requested association properties
- `"No_Value"` as a value for spans that don't have a value for the specified property
- `"Unknown_Value"` for spans where the property exists but has an empty value
