By default, all prompts and responses are logged.
If you've disabled this behavior by following [this guide](/openllmetry/privacy/traces),
and then [selectively enabled it for some of your users](/api-reference/tracing/whitelist_user) then you
can use this API to view which users you've enabled.

## Response

  association properties.
