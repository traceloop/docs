The following is a list of publicly available APIs you can use with the [Traceloop platform](https://app.traceloop.com).

All APIs require an API key to be used for authentication.

## Authentication

Use your API key as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Tip>
  The same API key you use to send traces to Traceloop can be used to query your data via the API.
