title: "Manually reporting calls to LLMs and Vector DBs"
description: "What should I do if my favorite vector DB or LLM is not supported by OpenLLMetry?"
---

The best thing about OpenLLMetry is that it supports a wide range of LLMs and vector DBs out of the box.
You just install the SDK and get metrics, traces and logs - without any extra work.

Checkout the list of supported systems on [Python](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry?tab=readme-ov-file#-what-do-we-instrument)
and on [Typescript](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry-js?tab=readme-ov-file#-what-do-we-instrument).

If your favorite vector DB or LLM is not supported by OpenLLMetry, you can still use OpenLLMetry to report the LLM and vector DB calls manually.
Please open an issue for us as well so we can prioritize adding support for your favorite system.

Here's how you can do that manually in the meantime:

## Reporting LLM calls

To track a call to an LLM, just wrap that call in your code with the `withLLMCall` function in Typescript or `track_llm_call` in Python.
These functions passes a parameter you can use to report the request and response from this call.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from traceloop.sdk.tracing.manual import LLMMessage, track_llm_call

with track_llm_call(vendor="openai", type="chat") as span:
  span.report_request(
      model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
      messages=[
          LLMMessage(role="user", content="Tell me a joke about opentelemetry")
      ],
  )

  res = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
      model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
      messages=[
          {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke about opentelemetry"}
      ],
  )

  span.report_response(res.model, [text.message.content for text in res.choices])
```
```javascript Typescript
traceloop.withLLMCall(
  { vendor: "openai", type: "chat" },
  async ({ span }) => {
    const messages: ChatCompletionMessageParam[] = [
      { role: "user", content: "Tell me a joke about OpenTelemetry" },
    ];
    const model = "gpt-3.5-turbo";

    span.reportRequest({ model, messages });

    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      messages,
      model,
    });

    span.reportResponse(response);

    return response;

})
````
</CodeGroup>

## Reporting Vector DB calls

To track a call to a vector DB, just wrap that call in your code with the `withVectorDBCall` function.
This function passes a parameter you can use to report the query vector as well as the results from this call.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Typescript
import * as traceloop from "@traceloop/node-server-sdk";

const results = await traceloop.withVectorDBCall(
    { vendor: "elastic", type: "query" },
    async ({ span }) => {
      span.reportQuery({ queryVector: [1, 2, 3] });

      // call the vector DB like you normally would
      const results = await client.knnSearch({
        ...
      });

      span.reportResults({
        results: [
          {
            ids: "1",
            scores: 0.5,
            distances: 0.1,
            metadata: { key: "value" },
            vectors: [1, 2, 3],
            documents: "doc",
          },
        ],
      });

      return results;
    },
  );
````
