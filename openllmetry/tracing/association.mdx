title: "Associating Entities with Traces"
description: "How to associate traces with entities in your own application"
---

Each trace you run is usually connected to entities in your own application -
things like `user_id`, `chat_id`, or anything else that is tied to the flow that triggered the trace.

OpenLLMetry allows you to easily mark traces with these IDs so you can track them in the UI.

```python Python
from traceloop.sdk import Traceloop
 
Traceloop.set_association_properties({ "user_id": "user12345", "chat_id": "chat12345" })
```

```js Typescript
traceloop.withAssociationProperties({
  userId: "user12345",
  chatId: "chat12345",
  () => {
    // Your code here
    // (can be async or sync)
  }
});
```
