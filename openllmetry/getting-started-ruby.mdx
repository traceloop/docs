Install Traceloop by following these 3 easy steps and get instant monitoring.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the SDK">

Run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
```bash gem
gem install traceloop-sdk
```

```bash bundler
bundle add traceloop-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

In your LLM app, initialize the Traceloop tracer like this:

<Tip>
  If you're using Rails, this needs to be in `config/initializers/traceloop.rb`
</Tip>

```ruby
require "traceloop/sdk"

traceloop = Traceloop::SDK::Traceloop.new
```

</Step>
<Step title="Log your prompts">
<Frame>
  <img src="/img/single_trace_prompt.png" />
</Frame>
For now, we don't automatically instrument libraries on Ruby (as opposed to Python and Javascript).
This will change in later versions.

This means that you'll need to manually log your prompts and completions.

```ruby
require "openai"

client = OpenAI::Client.new

# This tracks the latency of the call and the response
traceloop.llm_call() do |tracer|
  # Log the prompt
  tracer.log_prompt(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", user_prompt="Tell me a joke about OpenTelemetry")

  # Call OpenAI like you normally would
  response = client.chat(
    parameters: {
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Tell me a joke about OpenTelemetry" }]
    })

  # Pass the response form OpenAI as is to log the completion and token usage
  tracer.log_response(response)
end
```

</Step>
<Step title="Configure trace exporting">
Lastly, you'll need to configure where to export your traces.
The 2 environment variables controlling this are `TRACELOOP_API_KEY` and `TRACELOOP_BASE_URL`.

For Traceloop, read on. For other options, see [Exporting](/openllmetry/integrations/exporting).

### Using Traceloop Cloud

Go to [Traceloop](https://app.traceloop.com), and create a new account.
Then, click on **Environments** on the left-hand navigation bar. Or go to directly to https://app.traceloop.com/settings/api-keys.
Click **Generate API Key** to generate an API key for the developement environment and click **Copy API Key** to copy it over.

<Warning>Make sure to copy it as it won't be shown again.</Warning>

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/apikey.png" />
</Frame>

Set the copied Traceloop's API key as an environment variable in your app named `TRACELOOP_API_KEY`.

Done! You'll get instant visibility into everything that's happening with your LLM.
If you're calling a vector DB, or any other external service or database, you'll also see it in the Traceloop dashboard.
