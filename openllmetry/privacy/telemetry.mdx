OpenLLMetry contains a telemetry feature that collects **anonymous** usage information.

## Why?

We use this information to help us understand how OpenLLMetry is used, to help us prioritize work on new features and bug fixes,
and to help us improve OpenLLMetry's performance and stability.

## Opting out

If you prefer to opt out of telemetry, you can do this by setting the `TRACELOOP_TELEMETRY` environment variable to `FALSE`.

## What do you track?

We will only track usage details that help us make product decisions, specifically:

- OpenLLMetry version
- Tracing endpoint type (e.g. Honeycomb, Datadog, Traceloop, etc.)
- Types of instrumentations that were initialized
- Usage of prompt rendering (without logging any details about the prompt, variables, or values)

We **do not** collect personally-identifiable or sensitive information, such as: API keys, prompts, completions, embeddings, or spans and traces.

To view the list of events we track, you may reference the [code](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry/blob/main/packages/traceloop-sdk/traceloop/sdk/telemetry.py).

## Where is telemetry information stored?

We use Posthog to store and visualize telemetry data.
