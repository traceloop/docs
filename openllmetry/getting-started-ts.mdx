<Step title="Install the SDK">

</Tip>

Run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @traceloop/node-server-sdk
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @traceloop/node-server-sdk
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @traceloop/node-server-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

In your LLM app, initialize the Traceloop tracer like this:

```js
import * as traceloop from "@traceloop/node-server-sdk";

traceloop.initialize();
```

<Warning>
  Because of the way Javascript works, you must import the Traceloop SDK before
  importing any LLM module like OpenAI.
</Warning>

If you're running this locally, you may want to disable batch sending, so you can see the traces immediately:

```js
traceloop.initialize({ disableBatch: true });
```

<Note>
  If you're using Sentry, make sure to disable their OpenTelemetry configuration
  as it overrides OpenLLMetry. When calling `Sentry.init`, pass
  `skipOpenTelemetrySetup: true`.
</Note>

</Step>
<Step title="Annotate your workflows">
<Frame>
  <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/img/workflow-light.png" />
  <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/img/workflow-dark.png" />
</Frame>
If you have complex workflows or chains, you can annotate them to get a better understanding of what's going on.
You'll see the complete trace of your workflow on Traceloop or any other dashboard you're using.

We have a set of [methods and decorators](/openllmetry/tracing/annotations) to make this easier.
Assume you have a function that renders a prompt and calls an LLM, simply wrap it in a `withWorkflow()` function call.

We also have compatible Typescript decorators for class methods which are more convenient.

<Tip>
  If you're using a [supported LLM framework](/openllmetry/tracing/supported#frameworks) - 
  we'll do that for you. No need to add any annotations to your code.
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>
```js Functions (async / sync)
async function suggestAnswers(question: string) {
  return await withWorkflow({ name: "suggestAnswers" }, () => {
    ...
  });
}
```
```js Class Methods
class MyLLM {
  @traceloop.workflow({ name: "suggest_answers" })
  async suggestAnswers(question: string) {
    ...
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

For more information, see the [dedicated section in the docs](/openllmetry/tracing/annotations).

</Step>
<Step title="Configure trace exporting">
Lastly, you'll need to configure where to export your traces.
The 2 environment variables controlling this are `TRACELOOP_API_KEY` and `TRACELOOP_BASE_URL`.

For Traceloop, read on. For other options, see [Exporting](/openllmetry/integrations/introduction).

### Using Traceloop Cloud

<Note>
  You need an API key to send traces to Traceloop.
  [Generate one in Settings](https://app.traceloop.com/settings/api-keys) by selecting
  a project and environment, then click **Generate API key**.

  ⚠️ **Important:** Copy the key immediately - it won't be shown again after you close or reload the page.

  [Detailed instructions →](/settings/managing-api-keys)
</Note>

Set the API key as an environment variable in your app named `TRACELOOP_API_KEY`:

```bash
export TRACELOOP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Done! You'll get instant visibility into everything that's happening with your LLM.
If you're calling a vector DB, or any other external service or database, you'll also see it in the Traceloop dashboard.

<Tip>
  **Not seeing traces?** Make sure you're viewing the correct project and environment in the
  dashboard that matches your API key. See [Troubleshooting](/settings/managing-api-keys#troubleshooting).
