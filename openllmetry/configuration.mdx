Most configuration options can be set via environment variables or via the SDK's initialization options.

<Warning>
  The SDK initialization options always take precedence over the environment
  variables.
</Warning>
See below for the list of options.

## Application Name

You can customize the application name that will be logged with the traces. This is useful to identify if you have multiple services with
OpenLLMetry installed.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
Traceloop.init(app_name="my app name")
```

```js Typescript / Javascript
Traceloop.initialize({ appName: "my app name" });
```

</CodeGroup>

## Resource Attributes

You can further add any custom attributes to the OpenTelemetry resource. This is useful to add information about the environment
where the application is running, such as the environment name, the application version, etc.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
Traceloop.init(resource_attributes={"env": "prod", "version": "1.0.0"})
```

</CodeGroup>

## Base URL

This defines the OpenTelemetry endpoint to connect to. It defaults to https://api.traceloop.com

If you prefix it with `http` or `https`, it will use the OTLP/HTTP protocol.
Otherwise, it will use the OTLP/GRPC protocol.

For configuring this to different observability platform, check out our [integrations section](/openllmetry/integrations).

<Note>
  The OpenTelemetry standard defines that the actual endpoint should always end
  with `/v1/traces`. Thus, if you specify a base URL, we always append
  `/v1/traces` to it. This is similar to how `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` works
  in all OpenTelemetry SDKs.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```bash Environment Variable
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=<OpenTelemetry Endpoint>
```

```python Python
Traceloop.init(api_endpoint=<opentelemetry endpoint>)
```

```js Typescript / Javascript
Traceloop.initialize({ baseUrl: <opentelemetry endpoint> })
```

</CodeGroup>

## API Key

If set, this is sent as a bearer token on the Authorization header.

[Traceloop](/openllmetry/integrations/traceloop), for example, use this to authenticate incoming traces and requests.

<Tip>
  If this is not set, and the base URL is set to `https://api.traceloop.com`,
  the SDK will generate a new API key automatically with the Traceloop
  dashboard.
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>

```bash Environment Variable
TRACELOOP_API_KEY=<api key>
```

```python Python
Traceloop.init(api_key=<api key>)
```

```js Typescript / Javascript
Traceloop.initialize({ apiKey: <api key> })
```

</CodeGroup>

## Headers

If set, this is sent as-is as HTTP headers. This is useful for custom authentication protocols that some observability platforms require.
The format follows the [W3C Correlation-Context](https://github.com/w3c/baggage/blob/master/baggage/HTTP_HEADER_FORMAT.md) format, i.e.
`key1=value1,key2=value2`. If you need spaces, use `%20`.
This is similar to how `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` works in all OpenTelemetry SDKs.

<Note>If this is set, the API key is ignored.</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```bash Environment Variable
TRACELOOP_HEADERS=key1=value1,key2=value2
```

```python Python
Traceloop.init(headers={"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"})
```

```js Typescript / Javascript
Traceloop.initialize({ headers: { key1: "value1", key2: "value2" } });
```

</CodeGroup>

## Custom Traces Exporter

If, for some reason, you cannot use the OTLP/HTTP or OTLP/GRPC exporter that is provided with the SDK, you can set a custom
exporter (for example, to Jaeger, Zipkin, or others)

<Note>
  If this is set, Base URL, API key and headers configurations are ignored.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
Traceloop.init(exporter=ZipkinExporter(endpoint="http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans"))
```

```js Typescript / Javascript
Traceloop.initialize({ exporter: new ZipkinExporter() });
```

</CodeGroup>

## Disable Batch

By default, the SDK batches spans using the [OpenTelemetry batch span processor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/processor/batchprocessor/README.md).
When working locally, sometime you may wish to disable this behavior. You can do that with this flag.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
Traceloop.init(disable_batch=True)
```

```js Typescript / Javascript
Traceloop.initialize({ disableBatch: true });
```

</CodeGroup>

## Disable Tracing of Prompt Content

By default, OpenLLMetry logs prompts, completions, and embeddings to span attributes.

However, you may want to disable this logging for privacy reasons, as they may contain highly sensitive data from your users.
You may also simply want to reduce the size of your traces.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Environment Variable
TRACELOOP_TRACE_CONTENT=false
```

```js Typescript / Javascript
Traceloop.initialize({ traceContent: false });
```

</CodeGroup>

## Control Logging

You can control the logging level of the SDK. By default, the SDK logs at the WARN level.

<CodeGroup>

```js Typescript / Javascript
// one of "debug", "info", "warn", "error"
Traceloop.initialize({ logLevel: "debug" });
```

</CodeGroup>

## Control Telemetry

The SDK collects anonymous telemetry data to help us identify and fix issues with instrumentations.
You can disable this feature if needed.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Environment Variable
TRACELOOP_TELEMETRY=false
```

```python Python
Traceloop.init(telemetry_enabled=False)
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  For more information about what telemetry data we collect, please see our
  [Privacy
  documentation](https://www.traceloop.com/docs/openllmetry/privacy/telemetry).
</Note>

## Enrich Collected Metrics and Traces

By default, the SDK enriches collected metrics and traces with additional information such as the OpenAI token usage for streaming requests.
This may affect latency on the first request, as it needs to fetch the embeddings.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
Traceloop.init(should_enrich_metrics=False) 
```

```bash Environment Variable (JS/TS Only)
TRACELOOP_ENRICH_TOKENS=false
```

</CodeGroup>

## Traceloop Sync

By default, Traceloop Sync (for prompts and other configurations) is disabled, even if you're sending traces to Traceloop.
If you're using the prompt registry, you should enable it.
To enable it or change any defaults, see the example below. The values listed are the default values,
so you don't need to set them unless you want to change the defaults.

<Note>Traceloop Sync must be enabled in order to use the prompt registry.</Note>

<CodeGroup>
```bash Environment Variable
TRACELOOP_SYNC_ENABLED=true
TRACELOOP_SYNC_MAX_RETRIES=3
TRACELOOP_SYNC_POLLING_INTERVAL=60 # seconds
TRACELOOP_SYNC_DEV_POLLING_INTERVAL=5 # seconds
```

```python Python
Traceloop.init(traceloop_sync_enabled=True)
```

```js Typescript / Javascript
Traceloop.initialize({
  traceloopSyncEnabled: true,
  traceloopSyncMaxRetries: 3,
  traceloopSyncPollingInterval: 60, // in seconds
  traceloopSyncDevPollingInterval: 5, // in seconds
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Instrumentations

By default, the SDK automatically detects which models and frameworks you are using and instruments them for you.
You can override this and specify specific frameworks and models you want to instrument. This, for example, allow you to
specify that you want to log calls to OpenAI, but not Anthropic, or vice-versa.

You can either explictly specify the instruments you want to enable, or the ones you want to block.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from traceloop.sdk.instruments import Instruments

Traceloop.init(instruments={Instruments.OPENAI, Instruments.PINECONE})

# OR

Traceloop.init(block_instruments={Instruments.ANTHROPIC})

```
</CodeGroup>
```
