[Tencent APM](https://console.tencentcloud.com/apm), also known as `TAPM`, is a monitoring and observability platform that provides a comprehensive view of your application's performance and behavior.

Tencent APM natively supports OpenTelemetry, so you can use OpenLLMetry to trace your applications.

To integrate OpenLLMetry with Tencent APM, you'll need to configure your tracing endpoint and authentication:


```bash
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL="<TAPM_ENDPOINT>" # Use port `55681` rather than `4317` as the default port.
TRACELOOP_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer%20<TAPM_TOKEN>" # header values in env variables must be URLâ€‘encoded.
```

Tencent APM defaults to using port `4317` for the gRPC exporter, and we recommend using port `55681` instead here, which is the HTTP exporter port.
