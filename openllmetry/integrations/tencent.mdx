[Tencent APM](https://console.tencentcloud.com/apm) is a monitoring and observability platform that provides a comprehensive view of your application's performance and behavior.

Tencent APM(also known as `TAPM`) natively supports OpenTelemetry, so you can use OpenLLMetry to trace your applications on this platform.

To integrate OpenLLMetry with Tencent APM, you'll need to configure your tracing endpoint and authentication:


```bash
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL="<TAPM_ENDPOINT>" # Use port `55681` rather than `4317` as the default port.
TRACELOOP_HEADERS="Authorization=Bearer%20<TAPM_TOKEN>" # header values in env variables must be URLâ€‘encoded.
```

Tencent APM defaults to using port `4317` for the gRPC exporter; we recommend using port `55681` instead, which is the HTTP exporter port.
