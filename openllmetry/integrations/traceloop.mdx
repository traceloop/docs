[Traceloop](https://app.traceloop.com) is a platform for observability and evaluation of LLM outputs.
It allows you to deploy changes to prompts and model configurations with confidence, without breaking existing functionality.

## Connecting OpenLLMetry to Traceloop directly

<Note>
  You need an API key to send traces to Traceloop. API keys are scoped to a specific **project** and **environment**.

  **To generate an API key:**
  1. Go to [Settings → Organization](https://app.traceloop.com/settings/api-keys)
  2. Click on your project (or create a new one)
  3. Select an environment (Development, Staging, Production, or custom)
  4. Click **Generate API key**
  5. **Copy the key immediately** - it won't be shown again after you close or reload the page

  [Detailed instructions →](/settings/managing-api-keys)
</Note>

Set the API key as an environment variable named `TRACELOOP_API_KEY`:

```bash
export TRACELOOP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Done! You'll get instant visibility into everything that's happening with your LLM.
If you're calling a vector DB, or any other external service or database, you'll also see it in the Traceloop dashboard.

<Tip>
  **Want to organize your data?** Learn about [Projects and Environments](/settings/projects-and-environments)
  to separate traces for different applications and deployment stages.

## Using an OpenTelemetry Collector

If you are using an [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/), you can route metrics and traces to Traceloop by simply adding an OTLP exporter to your collector configuration.

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
processors:
  batch:
exporters:
  otlphttp/traceloop:
    endpoint: "https://api.traceloop.com" # US instance
    headers:
      "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>"
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlphttp/traceloop]
```

You can route OpenLLMetry to your collector by following the [OpenTelemetry Collector](/openllmetry/integrations/otel-collector) integration instructions.
