BMC Helix provides the capability to export observability data directly using the OpenTelemetry Collector. This requires deploying an OpenTelemetry Collector in your cluster.

See also [BMC Helix documentation](https://docs.bmc.com/xwiki/bin/view/IT-Operations-Management/Operations-Management/BMC-Helix-AIOps/aiops244/Administering/Enabling-BMC-Helix-applications-to-collect-service-traces-from-OpenTelemetry/).

Exporting Data to an OpenTelemetry Collector


```yaml
otlp:
  receiver:
    protocols:
      http:
        enabled: true
```

Then, set this env var, and you're done!

```bash
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=http://<tenantURL>
```
