With datadog, there are 2 options - you can either export directly to a Datadog Agent in your cluster, or through an OpenTelemetry Collector (which requires that you deploy one in your cluster).

See also [Datadog documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/opentelemetry/).

Exporting directly to an agent is easiest.
To do that, first enable the OTLP HTTP collector in your agent configuration.
This depends on how you deployed your Datadog agent. For example, if you've used a Helm chart,
you can add the following to your `values.yaml`
(see [this](https://docs.datadoghq.com/opentelemetry/otlp_ingest_in_the_agent/?tab=kuberneteshelmvaluesyaml#enabling-otlp-ingestion-on-the-datadog-agent) for other options):

```yaml
otlp:
  receiver:
    protocols:
      http:
        enabled: true
```

Then, set this env var, and you're done!

```bash
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=http://<datadog-agent-hostname>:4318
```
