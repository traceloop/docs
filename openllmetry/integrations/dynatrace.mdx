Analyze all collected LLM traces and logs within Dynatrace by using the native OpenTelemetry ingest endpoint of your Dynatrace environment.

Go to your Dynatrace environment and create a new access token under **Manage Access Tokens**.  
The access token needs the following permission scopes that allow the ingest of OpenTelemetry spans, metrics and logs
(openTelemetryTrace.ingest, metrics.ingest, logs.ingest).

Set `TRACELOOP_BASE_URL` environment variable to the URL of your Dynatrace OpenTelemetry ingest endpoint

```bash
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=https://<YOUR_ENV>.live.dynatrace.com\api\v2\otlp
```

Set the `TRACELOOP_HEADERS` environment variable to include your previously created access token

```bash
TRACELOOP_HEADERS=Authorization=Api-Token%20<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>
```

Done! All exported spans, along with their span attributes, will appear within the [Dynatrace trace view](https://wkf10640.apps.dynatrace.com/ui/apps/dynatrace.genai.observability).
