With Instana, you can export directly to a Instana Agent in your cluster, Instana Agent will report back the tracing and metrics back to Instana Backend and display all of the tracing and metrics on Instana UI.

After instana OS agent installed. edit agent config file configuration.yaml under `/opt/instana/agent/etc/instana` folder.

```
cd /opt/instana/agent/etc/instana
vi configuration.yaml
```

Add following to the file:

```
com.instana.plugin.opentelemetry:
  enabled: true
  grpc:
    enabled: true
```

Restart the instana agent:

```
systemctl restart instana-agent.service
```

The instana agent should be ready for opentelemetry data at port 4317.

Then, set this env var, and you're done!

```bash
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=<instana-agent-hostname>:4317
```
