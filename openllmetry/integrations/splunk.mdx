Collecting and analyzing LLM traces in [Splunk Observability Cloud](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/observability.html) can be achieve by configuring the **TRACELOOP_BASE_URL** environment variable to point to the [Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/releases) OTLP endpoint.

Have the Collector run in gateway mode and ensure the OTLP receiver is configured, see [Get data into Splunk Observability Cloud](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/gdi/get-data-in/get-data-in.html).

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: "0.0.0.0:4317"
      http:
        endpoint: "0.0.0.0:4318"
```

Secondly, ensure the OTLP exporter is configured to send to Splunk Observability Cloud:

```yaml
exporters:
  # Traces
  sapm:
    access_token: "${SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
    endpoint: "https://ingest.${SPLUNK_REALM}.signalfx.com/v2/trace"
    sending_queue:
      num_consumers: 32
```

Thirdly, make sure `otlp` is defined in the traces pipeline:

```yaml
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [jaeger, otlp, sapm, zipkin]
      processors:
      - memory_limiter
      - batch
      #- resource/add_environment
      exporters: [sapm]
```

Finally, define the `TRACELOOP_BASE_URL` environment variable to point to the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector OTLP endpoint:


```bash
TRACELOOP_BASE_URL=http://<splunk-otel-collector>:4318
```
