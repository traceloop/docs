You can also check out our full working example with Next.js 13 [here](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry-nextjs-demo).

Install Traceloop by following these 3 easy steps and get instant monitoring.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the SDK">

Run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @traceloop/node-server-sdk
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm install @traceloop/node-server-sdk
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @traceloop/node-server-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

Whenever you use an LLM or a vector DB (API routes, `getServerSideProps()`, etc.),
you'll need to import the Traceloop SDK and initialize it. Make sure to pass
the modules you'd like to instrument and set `disableBatch` to `true`.

```js
import * as traceloop from "@traceloop/node-server-sdk";
import OpenAI from "openai";

traceloop.initialize({
  disableBatch: true,
  instrumentModules: {
    openAI: OpenAI,
  },
});
```

</Step>

<Step title="Configure trace exporting">
<Tip>
  If you just want to explore - you don't need to do anything! Just run your app
  without setting any environment variable and a new account will automatically
  be created for you so you can start seeing traces from your developement
  environment.
</Tip>
Lastly, you'll need to configure where to export your traces.
The 2 environment variables controlling this are `TRACELOOP_API_KEY` and `TRACELOOP_BASE_URL`.

For Traceloop, read on. For other options, see [Exporting](/openllmetry/exporting).

### Using Traceloop Cloud

Go to [Traceloop](https://app.traceloop.com), and create a new account.
Then, click on the cog button on the top right corner, and choose environments. Or go to directly to https://app.traceloop.com/settings/api-keys.
Click **Generate API Key** to generate an API key for the developement environment and click **Copy API Key** to copy it over.

<Warning>Make sure to copy it as it won't be shown again.</Warning>

</Frame>

Set the copied Traceloop's API key as an environment variable in your app named `TRACELOOP_API_KEY`.

Done! You'll get instant visibility into everything that's happening with your LLM.
If you're calling a vector DB, or any other external service or database, you'll also see it in the Traceloop dashboard.
