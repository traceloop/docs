You can also check out our full working example of a RAG pipeline with Pinecone [here](https://github.com/traceloop/pinecone-demo).

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the SDK">

Run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>

```bash pip
pip install traceloop-sdk
```

```bash poetry
poetry add traceloop-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

In your LLM app, initialize the Traceloop tracer like this:

```python
from traceloop.sdk import Traceloop

Traceloop.init()
```

If you're running this locally, you may want to disable batch sending, so you can see the traces immediately:

```python
Traceloop.init(disable_batch=True)
```

</Step>
<Step title="Annotate your workflows">
<Frame>
  <img src="/img/workflow.png" />
</Frame>
If you have complex workflows or chains, you can annotate them to get a better understanding of what's going on.
You'll see the complete trace of your workflow on Traceloop or any other dashboard you're using.

We have a set of [decorators](/openllmetry/tracing/annotations) to make this easier.
Assume you have a function that renders a prompt and calls an LLM, simply add `@workflow` (or for asynchronous methods - `@aworkflow`).

<Tip>
  If you're using an LLM framework like Haystack, Langchain or LlamaIndex -
  we'll do that for you. No need to add any annotations to your code.
</Tip>

```python
from traceloop.sdk.decorators import workflow

@workflow(name="suggest_answers")
def suggest_answers(question: str):
  ...
```

For more information, see the [dedicated section in the docs](/openllmetry/tracing/annotations).

</Step>
<Step title="Configure trace exporting">
<Tip>
  If you just want to explore - you don't need to do anything! Just run your app
  without setting any environment variable and a new account will automatically
  be created for you so you can start seeing traces from your developement
  environment.
</Tip>
Lastly, you'll need to configure where to export your traces.
The 2 environment variables controlling this are `TRACELOOP_API_KEY` and `TRACELOOP_BASE_URL`.

For Traceloop, read on. For other options, see [Exporting](/openllmetry/integrations/introduction).

### Using Traceloop Cloud

Go to [Traceloop](https://app.traceloop.com), and create a new account.
Then, click on **Environments** on the left-hand navigation bar. Or go to directly to https://app.traceloop.com/settings/api-keys.
Click **Generate API Key** to generate an API key for the developement environment and click **Copy API Key** to copy it over.

<Warning>Make sure to copy it as it won't be shown again.</Warning>

<Frame>
  <img src="/img/apikey.png" />
</Frame>

Set the copied Traceloop's API key as an environment variable in your app named `TRACELOOP_API_KEY`.

Done! You'll get instant visibility into everything that's happening with your LLM.
If you're calling a vector DB, or any other external service or database, you'll also see it in the Traceloop dashboard.
