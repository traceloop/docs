You can also check out our full working example of a RAG pipeline with Pinecone [here](https://github.com/traceloop/pinecone-demo).

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the SDK">

Run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>

```bash pip
pip install traceloop-sdk
```

```bash poetry
poetry add traceloop-sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

In your LLM app, initialize the Traceloop tracer like this:

```python
from traceloop.sdk import Traceloop

Traceloop.init()
```

If you're running this locally, you may want to disable batch sending, so you can see the traces immediately:

```python
Traceloop.init(disable_batch=True)
```

</Step>
<Step title="Annotate your workflows">
<Frame>
  <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/img/workflow-light.png" />
  <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/img/workflow-dark.png" />
</Frame>
If you have complex workflows or chains, you can annotate them to get a better understanding of what's going on.
You'll see the complete trace of your workflow on Traceloop or any other dashboard you're using.

We have a set of [decorators](/openllmetry/tracing/annotations) to make this easier.
Assume you have a function that renders a prompt and calls an LLM, simply add `@workflow`.

<Warning>
  The `@aworkflow` decorator is deprecated and will be removed in a future
  version. Use `@workflow` for both synchronous and asynchronous operations.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  If you're using an LLM framework like Haystack, Langchain or LlamaIndex -
  we'll do that for you. No need to add any annotations to your code.
</Tip>

```python
from traceloop.sdk.decorators import workflow

@workflow(name="suggest_answers")
def suggest_answers(question: str):
  ...

# Works seamlessly with async functions too
@workflow(name="summarize")
async def summarize(long_text: str):
  ...
```

For more information, see the [dedicated section in the docs](/openllmetry/tracing/annotations).

</Step>
<Step title="Configure trace exporting">
Lastly, you'll need to configure where to export your traces.
The 2 environment variables controlling this are `TRACELOOP_API_KEY` and `TRACELOOP_BASE_URL`.

For Traceloop, read on. For other options, see [Exporting](/openllmetry/integrations/introduction).

### Using Traceloop Cloud

Go to [Traceloop](https://app.traceloop.com), and create a new account.
Then, click on **Environments** on the left-hand navigation bar. Or go to directly to https://app.traceloop.com/settings/api-keys.
Click **Generate API Key** to generate an API key for the developement environment and click **Copy API Key** to copy it over.

<Warning>Make sure to copy it as it won't be shown again.</Warning>

<Frame>
  <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/img/api-key-light.png" />
  <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/img/api-key-dark.png" />
</Frame>

Set the copied Traceloop's API key as an environment variable in your app named `TRACELOOP_API_KEY`.

Done! You'll get instant visibility into everything that's happening with your LLM.
If you're calling a vector DB, or any other external service or database, you'll also see it in the Traceloop dashboard.
